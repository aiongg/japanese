# Shiba Study Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the ongoing refactoring efforts for the Shiba Study application. The primary goal is to improve code organization, maintainability, and performance by breaking down large components into smaller, more focused ones and extracting reusable logic into custom hooks.

## Completed Refactoring

### 1. Component Extraction

We've successfully extracted several UI components from the monolithic `DeckView.tsx`:

- **ProgressBar**: Displays the current progress through the deck
- **NavigationButtons**: Controls for navigating between cards
- **StudyModeControls**: Settings for study mode preferences
- **AudioSettings**: Controls for audio playback options
- **KeyboardShortcutsInfo**: Displays available keyboard shortcuts

### 2. Custom Hooks Creation

We've extracted complex logic into dedicated custom hooks:

- **useDeckNavigation**: Manages deck navigation and card progression
- **useFlashcardState**: Handles flashcard state and animations
- **useKeyboardShortcuts**: Manages keyboard interactions
- **useAudio**: Controls audio playback and listen mode (existed previously)

### 3. State Management Improvements

- Replaced `sessionStorage` with React state for better performance and maintainability
- Implemented proper state synchronization between parent components and hooks
- Added callback props to ensure state updates are properly propagated

## Current Focus

We are currently focusing on:

1. Fixing regressions introduced during refactoring
2. Ensuring proper state synchronization between components
3. Improving the bidirectional communication between hooks and parent components

## Planned Refactoring

### 1. Touch Gesture Handling

- Extract touch gesture logic from `Flashcard.tsx` into a custom `useTouchGestures` hook
- Improve swipe animations and physics
- Ensure consistent behavior across different devices

### 2. Audio State Management

- Implement a reducer for audio state management
- Simplify the audio service API
- Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize animations for better performance
- Implement proper memoization of callback functions

### 4. Code Quality Improvements

- Add comprehensive comments
- Standardize naming conventions
- Improve type definitions

## Refactoring Prompts Used

1. **Initial Component Breakdown**:
   "Let's refactor the DeckView.tsx component to make it more maintainable. It's currently too large and has too many responsibilities. Let's extract some of the functionality into separate components and custom hooks."

2. **Custom Hooks Extraction**:
   "Extract the deck navigation logic from DeckView.tsx into a custom hook called useDeckNavigation that manages the current index, random mode, and navigation functions."

3. **Flashcard State Management**:
   "Create a custom hook called useFlashcardState to manage the state related to showing/hiding answers and animations."

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   "Extract the keyboard shortcut handling into a custom hook called useKeyboardShortcuts."

5. **UI Component Extraction**:
   "Extract the progress bar, navigation buttons, study mode controls, audio settings, and keyboard shortcuts info into separate reusable components."

6. **SessionStorage Replacement**:
   "Replace the use of sessionStorage for the flip animation with React state for better performance and maintainability."

7. **State Synchronization**:
   "Implement proper bidirectional state synchronization between the useFlashcardState hook and the DeckView component."

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components and hooks are easier to understand and modify
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each component and hook has a clear, single responsibility
3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Components and hooks can be reused across the application
4. **Reduced Complexity**: The main DeckView component is now much simpler and easier to understand
5. **Improved Performance**: Better state management reduces unnecessary re-renders
6. **Better Testability**: Smaller, focused components and hooks are easier to test
7. **Easier Collaboration**: Team members can work on different components without conflicts

## Next Steps

1. Complete the touch gesture hook extraction
2. Implement the audio state reducer
3. Address any remaining regressions
4. Add comprehensive documentation
5. Consider additional performance optimizations
