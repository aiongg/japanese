# Introduction to Kana

こんにちは, エドワード! Welcome to this special lesson on Japanese Kana, the syllabic scripts that form the foundation of reading and writing in Japanese. Unlike numbered lessons tied to specific vacation scenarios, this lesson stands alone to give you a deep dive into Hiragana and Katakana—two essential writing systems you'll encounter everywhere in Japan, from signs to menus. Since you’re already familiar with pronouncing Hiragana and Katakana from your basic Japanese knowledge, this lesson will expand your understanding by exploring their sounds, historical origins, and practical use. We'll cover all possible sounds (base, voiced, semi-voiced, and combinations), their Kanji roots through Manyōgana, and even tips on handwritten forms to help you read and write like a native. Let’s get started!

## Kana Overview

Japanese uses three writing systems: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana, collectively called Kana, are phonetic syllabaries—each character represents a syllable (e.g., か is "ka"). Hiragana is used for native Japanese words, grammatical endings, and sometimes as furigana (small readings above Kanji). Katakana is primarily for foreign loanwords (e.g., コーヒー - "coffee"), onomatopoeia, and emphasis. Both evolved from Kanji through a system called Manyōgana, which we’ll explore later. Below are tables listing all Kana sounds, including base forms, voiced (_゛_), semi-voiced (_゜_), and _yōon_ (combinations with _ゃ, ゅ, ょ_).

## Additional Sounds and Explanations

### Standalone Nasal Sound

The _n_ sound (ん/ン) is a standalone nasal consonant that doesn’t pair with vowels beyond _u_. It’s used at the end of syllables (e.g., こんにちは - _konnichiha_) and doesn’t fit the consonant-vowel structure of the main tables.

| Sound | Hiragana | Katakana | English Gloss |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| n     | ん        | ン        | nasal "n"     |

### Obsolete Sounds

These sounds (_ゐ/ヰ_ and _ゑ/ヱ_) were historically part of the _w_ row but are rarely used today, except in specific names or archaic contexts (e.g., sake brand ゑびす - _Ebis_). They’re included in the _w_ row but noted here for clarity.

| Sound | Hiragana | Katakana | English Gloss   |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| wi    | ゐ        | ヰ        | "wi" (obsolete) |
| we    | ゑ        | ヱ        | "we" (obsolete) |

### Notes on Voiced and Semi-Voiced Sounds

* **Voiced Sounds (**_**゛**_**):** Add dakuten (_゛_) to unvoiced consonants to make them voiced:
  * _k_ → _g_ (e.g., か → が)
  * _s_ → _z_ (e.g., さ → ざ, し → じ)
  * _t_ → _d_ (e.g., た → だ, ち → ぢ)
  * _h_ → _b_ (e.g., は → ば)
* **Semi-Voiced Sounds (**_**゜**_**):** Add handakuten (_゜_) to _h_ sounds to make _p_ (e.g., は → ぱ).
* _ぢ/ヂ_ and _づ/ヅ_ are less common than _じ/ジ_ and _ず/ズ_, often replaced by the latter in modern usage, but remain distinct in some dialects or words (e.g., ちぢむ - _chijimu_, to shrink).

### Yōon (Combination Sounds)

_Yōon_ are contracted sounds combining a consonant with a small _ゃ, ゅ, ょ_ (ya, yu, yo). They’re included in the main tables under additional columns. Not all consonants form _yōon_:

* Common: _k, g, s, z, t, n, h, b, p, m, r_ (e.g., きゃ, ぎゃ, しゃ).
* Rare/Absent: _d_ rarely forms _yōon_ (e.g., ぢゃ is uncommon and usually written as じゃ).

### Rare or Exceptional Sounds

Some sounds appear in Katakana for foreign loanwords and don’t fit the standard grid. These are written with extended characters to approximate non-Japanese sounds:

| Sound | Katakana | English Gloss          |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| ti    | ティ       | "ti" (e.g., "party")   |
| di    | ディ       | "di" (e.g., "radio")   |
| tu    | トゥ       | "tu" (e.g., "two")     |
| du    | ドゥ       | "du" (e.g., "do")      |
| fa    | ファ       | "fa" (e.g., "family")  |
| fi    | フィ       | "fi" (e.g., "film")    |
| fe    | フェ       | "fe" (e.g., "fever")   |
| fo    | フォ       | "fo" (e.g., "four")    |
| va    | ヴァ       | "va" (e.g., "van")     |
| vi    | ヴィ       | "vi" (e.g., "video")   |
| ve    | ヴェ       | "ve" (e.g., "veteran") |
| vo    | ヴォ       | "vo" (e.g., "vote")    |

## Manyōgana: The Kanji Origins of Kana

Before Hiragana and Katakana, Japanese was written using Manyōgana—Kanji chosen for their phonetic values rather than meaning. Named after the _Manyōshū_ (8th-century poetry anthology), this system was simplified over time into the cursive Hiragana and angular Katakana we use today. Below is a table showing the primary Kanji from which each Kana was derived. Note that multiple Kanji were sometimes used for the same sound; this table lists common examples.

| Sound | Hiragana | Kanji | Katakana | Kanji |

### Notes on Manyōgana:

* **Origins:** Hiragana evolved from cursive forms of Manyōgana Kanji, written quickly by hand, while Katakana came from abbreviated parts of the same Kanji, often used by monks for annotations.
* **Multiple Sources:** Some sounds had multiple Kanji options (e.g., _ka_ could be 加, 可, etc.); the table shows the most commonly cited origins.
* **Simplification:** Over centuries, these complex Kanji were standardized into the simpler Kana forms we use today, finalized in the 1900s.

## Handwritten Kana vs. Print Kana

Handwritten Kana often differs slightly from printed forms due to natural writing flow. These differences can affect legibility when reading signs, notes, or handwriting in Japan. Here are key distinctions:

* **Stroke Order:** Essential for proper shape. For example, さ (_sa_) has three strokes: a diagonal, a curve, and a hook. Incorrect order can make it look like ち (_chi_).
* **Shape Variations:**
  * き (_ki_): Printed as distinct strokes; handwritten often connects the vertical and diagonal lines into a smoother curve.
  * そ (_so_) vs. ん (_n_): Printed _そ_ has two separate strokes, while _ん_ is one continuous stroke. Handwritten versions can blur this distinction if rushed.
  * を (_wo_): Printed with a clear loop; handwritten often simplifies the loop into a single curve.
* **Size and Proportion:** Small _yōon_ characters (_ゃ, ゅ, ょ_) are half-sized in print but may vary in handwriting, sometimes appearing larger or misaligned.
* **Examples to Watch:**
  * Printed ね (_ne_) vs. handwritten: The loop may be tighter or more open.
  * Printed ふ (_fu_) vs. handwritten: The top curve might connect to the vertical stroke.

### Resources for Handwritten Kana Practice:

* **Workbooks:** "Kakitorikun" or "Genki" series include stroke order and handwriting practice.
* **Online Tools:** Websites like _Kakijun_ (http://kakijun.jp) show animated stroke order for each Kana.
* **Apps:** "Kana Practice" or "Dr. Moku" offer interactive exercises with examples of handwritten forms.
* **Real-Life Exposure:** Look at handwritten signs in Japan (e.g., restaurant menus) or ask native speakers to write samples for you.

## Practical Tips for Learners

* **Memorization:** Use the _gojūon_ order (あ, い, う, え, お, then か, き…) to memorize Kana systematically. Flashcards or apps like Anki can help.
* **Pronunciation:** Practice with audio (e.g., YouTube channels like "Japanese Ammo with Misa") to match sounds to characters, especially for tricky pairs like し (_shi_) vs. じ (_ji_).
* **Reading Practice:** Start with simple words (e.g., こんにちは - _konnichiha_, コーヒー - _kōhī_) to build fluency.
* **Writing Practice:** Use graph paper to keep sizes consistent, especially for _yōon_ (e.g., きゃ vs. きや).
* **Pitch Accent:** While not shown here, Kana pronunciation varies by pitch (e.g., はし - _hashi_ can mean "bridge" or "chopsticks" depending on pitch). Listen to native speakers to catch these nuances.

That’s your introduction to Kana! With this foundation, you’re ready to tackle reading and writing in Japanese, from menus to train tickets. がんばってください (_ganbatte kudasai_)!
