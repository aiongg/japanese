# Introduction to Kana

こんにちは, エドワード! Welcome to this special lesson on Japanese Kana, the syllabic scripts that form the foundation of reading and writing in Japanese. Unlike numbered lessons tied to specific vacation scenarios, this lesson stands alone to give you a deep dive into Hiragana and Katakana—two essential writing systems you'll encounter everywhere in Japan, from signs to menus. Since you’re already familiar with pronouncing Hiragana and Katakana from your basic Japanese knowledge, this lesson will expand your understanding by exploring their sounds, historical origins, and practical use. We'll cover all possible sounds (base, voiced, semi-voiced, and combinations), their Kanji roots through Manyōgana, and even tips on handwritten forms to help you read and write like a native. Let’s get started!

## Kana Overview

Japanese uses three writing systems: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana, collectively called Kana, are phonetic syllabaries—each character represents a syllable (e.g., か is "ka"). Hiragana is used for native Japanese words, grammatical endings, and sometimes as furigana (small readings above Kanji). Katakana is primarily for foreign loanwords (e.g., コーヒー - "coffee"), onomatopoeia, and emphasis. Both evolved from Kanji through a system called Manyōgana, which we’ll explore later. Below are tables listing all Kana sounds, including base forms, voiced (*゛*), semi-voiced (*゜*), and *yōon* (combinations with *ゃ, ゅ, ょ*).

## Additional Sounds and Explanations

### Standalone Nasal Sound
The *n* sound (ん/ン) is a standalone nasal consonant that doesn’t pair with vowels beyond *u*. It’s used at the end of syllables (e.g., こんにちは - *konnichiha*) and doesn’t fit the consonant-vowel structure of the main tables.

| Sound | Hiragana | Katakana | English Gloss |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|
| n     | ん       | ン       | nasal "n"     |

### Obsolete Sounds
These sounds (*ゐ/ヰ* and *ゑ/ヱ*) were historically part of the *w* row but are rarely used today, except in specific names or archaic contexts (e.g., sake brand ゑびす - *Ebis*). They’re included in the *w* row but noted here for clarity.

| Sound | Hiragana | Katakana | English Gloss       |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| wi    | ゐ       | ヰ       | "wi" (obsolete)     |
| we    | ゑ       | ヱ       | "we" (obsolete)     |

### Notes on Voiced and Semi-Voiced Sounds
- **Voiced Sounds (*゛*):** Add dakuten (*゛*) to unvoiced consonants to make them voiced:
  - *k* → *g* (e.g., か → が)
  - *s* → *z* (e.g., さ → ざ, し → じ)
  - *t* → *d* (e.g., た → だ, ち → ぢ)
  - *h* → *b* (e.g., は → ば)
- **Semi-Voiced Sounds (*゜*):** Add handakuten (*゜*) to *h* sounds to make *p* (e.g., は → ぱ).
- *ぢ/ヂ* and *づ/ヅ* are less common than *じ/ジ* and *ず/ズ*, often replaced by the latter in modern usage, but remain distinct in some dialects or words (e.g., ちぢむ - *chijimu*, to shrink).

### Yōon (Combination Sounds)
*Yōon* are contracted sounds combining a consonant with a small *ゃ, ゅ, ょ* (ya, yu, yo). They’re included in the main tables under additional columns. Not all consonants form *yōon*:
- Common: *k, g, s, z, t, n, h, b, p, m, r* (e.g., きゃ, ぎゃ, しゃ).
- Rare/Absent: *d* rarely forms *yōon* (e.g., ぢゃ is uncommon and usually written as じゃ).

### Rare or Exceptional Sounds
Some sounds appear in Katakana for foreign loanwords and don’t fit the standard grid. These are written with extended characters to approximate non-Japanese sounds:

| Sound | Katakana | English Gloss       |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| ti    | ティ     | "ti" (e.g., "party") |
| di    | ディ     | "di" (e.g., "radio") |
| tu    | トゥ     | "tu" (e.g., "two")   |
| du    | ドゥ     | "du" (e.g., "do")    |
| fa    | ファ     | "fa" (e.g., "family") |
| fi    | フィ     | "fi" (e.g., "film")  |
| fe    | フェ     | "fe" (e.g., "fever") |
| fo    | フォ     | "fo" (e.g., "four")  |
| va    | ヴァ     | "va" (e.g., "van")   |
| vi    | ヴィ     | "vi" (e.g., "video") |
| ve    | ヴェ     | "ve" (e.g., "veteran") |
| vo    | ヴォ     | "vo" (e.g., "vote")  |

## Manyōgana: The Kanji Origins of Kana

Before Hiragana and Katakana, Japanese was written using Manyōgana—Kanji chosen for their phonetic values rather than meaning. Named after the *Manyōshū* (8th-century poetry anthology), this system was simplified over time into the cursive Hiragana and angular Katakana we use today. Below is a table showing the primary Kanji from which each Kana was derived. Note that multiple Kanji were sometimes used for the same sound; this table lists common examples.

| Sound | Hiragana | Kanji | Katakana | Kanji |

### Notes on Manyōgana:
- **Origins:** Hiragana evolved from cursive forms of Manyōgana Kanji, written quickly by hand, while Katakana came from abbreviated parts of the same Kanji, often used by monks for annotations.
- **Multiple Sources:** Some sounds had multiple Kanji options (e.g., *ka* could be 加, 可, etc.); the table shows the most commonly cited origins.
- **Simplification:** Over centuries, these complex Kanji were standardized into the simpler Kana forms we use today, finalized in the 1900s.

## Handwritten Kana vs. Print Kana

Handwritten Kana often differs slightly from printed forms due to natural writing flow. These differences can affect legibility when reading signs, notes, or handwriting in Japan. Here are key distinctions:

- **Stroke Order:** Essential for proper shape. For example, さ (*sa*) has three strokes: a diagonal, a curve, and a hook. Incorrect order can make it look like ち (*chi*).
- **Shape Variations:**
  - き (*ki*): Printed as distinct strokes; handwritten often connects the vertical and diagonal lines into a smoother curve.
  - そ (*so*) vs. ん (*n*): Printed *そ* has two separate strokes, while *ん* is one continuous stroke. Handwritten versions can blur this distinction if rushed.
  - を (*wo*): Printed with a clear loop; handwritten often simplifies the loop into a single curve.
- **Size and Proportion:** Small *yōon* characters (*ゃ, ゅ, ょ*) are half-sized in print but may vary in handwriting, sometimes appearing larger or misaligned.
- **Examples to Watch:**
  - Printed ね (*ne*) vs. handwritten: The loop may be tighter or more open.
  - Printed ふ (*fu*) vs. handwritten: The top curve might connect to the vertical stroke.

### Resources for Handwritten Kana Practice:
- **Workbooks:** "Kakitorikun" or "Genki" series include stroke order and handwriting practice.
- **Online Tools:** Websites like *Kakijun* (http://kakijun.jp) show animated stroke order for each Kana.
- **Apps:** "Kana Practice" or "Dr. Moku" offer interactive exercises with examples of handwritten forms.
- **Real-Life Exposure:** Look at handwritten signs in Japan (e.g., restaurant menus) or ask native speakers to write samples for you.

## Practical Tips for Learners

- **Memorization:** Use the *gojūon* order (あ, い, う, え, お, then か, き…) to memorize Kana systematically. Flashcards or apps like Anki can help.
- **Pronunciation:** Practice with audio (e.g., YouTube channels like "Japanese Ammo with Misa") to match sounds to characters, especially for tricky pairs like し (*shi*) vs. じ (*ji*).
- **Reading Practice:** Start with simple words (e.g., こんにちは - *konnichiha*, コーヒー - *kōhī*) to build fluency.
- **Writing Practice:** Use graph paper to keep sizes consistent, especially for *yōon* (e.g., きゃ vs. きや).
- **Pitch Accent:** While not shown here, Kana pronunciation varies by pitch (e.g., はし - *hashi* can mean "bridge" or "chopsticks" depending on pitch). Listen to native speakers to catch these nuances.

That’s your introduction to Kana! With this foundation, you’re ready to tackle reading and writing in Japanese, from menus to train tickets. がんばってください (*ganbatte kudasai*)!
